## Creating the project 
* Add the constraint file found in Constraints.

* Add the source files found in Sources.

* Add the simulation files found in Testbenches.

## How to play the game
* Use switches 0 - 7 to choose a pattern.

* Use switches 14 & 15 to change the speed of the pattern.

* Use switch 13 to reset any progress.

1. To start the game, press the middle button when the display says begn.

2. The left two anodes will display the level while the right two anodes will display a pattern using two segments indicating top, bottom, left, or right.

3. After the pattern is shown, repeat the pattern into the corresponding buttons.

4. Successfully repeating the pattern will advance you to the next level. 

4. Continue this process of watching the pattern and repeating the pattern until you fail or reach level 15.

5. Once you fail or reach level 15, the display will read end and turn back to begn.
